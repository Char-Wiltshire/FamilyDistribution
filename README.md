Family of Distribution:

Exponential Distribution
Models the time between events in a Poisson process. It is memoryless and often used to represent lifetimes of products or time until failure.

Normal Distribution
A symmetric, bell-shaped distribution defined by mean and standard deviation. It is widely used due to the Central Limit Theorem and represents natural variations.

Poisson Distribution
Models the number of events in a fixed interval of time or space when events occur independently. Commonly used in queuing, traffic, and defect counts.

Binomial Distribution
Useful for pass/fail or win/lose scenarios with constant probability.

Triangular Distribution
A simple distribution with minimum, maximum, and most likely values. Often used in project management and estimation when limited data is available.

Lognormal Distribution
Describes a variable whose logarithm is normally distributed. It is skewed right and often used for modeling income, stock prices, or biological growth.

Gamma Distribution
Used to model waiting times for multiple events. It's a flexible distribution with shape and rate parameters.

Beta Distribution
Defined on the interval it models proportions or probabilities.
Weibull Distribution
It can model increasing, constant, or decreasing failure rates depending on its shape parameter.

Uniform Distribution
All outcomes are equally likely within a given range.
